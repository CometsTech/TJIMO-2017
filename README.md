Usage
---
Access the GitHub repository: https://github.com/CometsTech/TJIMO-2017.git

Please add all of your packages and macros to tjimo.sty; for each round,
please make a folder in which you add your .tex files. Keep the practice
round for each round in the same folder as the actual round.

At the beginning of each round, please call

\usepackage{../tjimo}

You do not need to separate answers and solutions from the problems file. Put everything in one .tex file. Observe lines 8-13 in individual.tex. When compiled with those lines, the result is the solutions pdf. Comment lines 8 and 13 to get the pdf with problems only.
